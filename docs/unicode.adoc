= Unicode Mode

This document explains how to use xsys35c to translate games into
languages other than Japanese or English. To run these translated games,
https://github.com/kichikuou/xsystem35-sdl2[xsystem35] is required.

== The `unicode` Option

Normally, strings in AliceSoft's scenario files are stored in CP932, a Japanese
character encoding used in Windows (which also covers English letters). The
`unicode` option in xsys35c allows you to output a scenario file encoded in
UTF-8. The generated scenario will not be compatible with the original System
3.x, but it will work with xsystem35, enabling the use of languages other than
Japanese or English.

== Translation Workflow

1. Decompile the game using xref:xsys35dc.adoc[`xsys35dc`].
2. Open the `xsys35c.cfg` file in the `decompiled` folder and add the following
   line:

     unicode = true

3. Build the scenario file using xref:xsys35c.adoc[`xsys35c`]. The generated
   scenario file will contain the same content as the original, but it will be
   encoded in UTF-8.
4. Overwrite the original scenario file with the generated one (don't forget to
   back up the original file) and run it using `xsystem35`. The game should
   function as it did before. (If not, please report the bug!)
5. You can now insert strings in any language into the source files. Modify the
   source files and repeat steps 3-4.

== Fonts

The fonts included with xsystem35 cover only Japanese characters, so you'll
need to provide a font that supports your target language.

If you're translating from Japanese, it would be beneficial to use a font that
supports both Japanese and your target language.
http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html[GNU Unifont] is a good candidate and
is used in the example at the top of this document.

To change the font in xsystem35, place the font files (`.ttf` or `.otf`) in the
game folder (where `*.ALD` files are located), and create a file named
`.xsys35rc` in the same folder. Include the following contents in the file,
replacing the font file names as necessary:

  ttfont_gothic: your-sans-serif-font.ttf
  ttfont_mincho: your-serif-font.ttf
